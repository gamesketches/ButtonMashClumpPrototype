Start	He was your king, and you mock his death!	I promise, my heart is broken over his loss.	Enough jokes! You cannot laugh off the sunrise!	I always knew he'd fall to pieces one day.	Tut tut, Horus. You take things too seriously.	I am in no mood for laughter, Set.	Now you will take ME seriously.	Something troubling you? You seem a little...scattered.
H1S0	This changes nothing!	How right you are, boy. I am still king.	Time to wipe that grin off your face.	This changes nothing.	Careful, boy. You're starting to annoy me.	I'm no man's boy. I will be king!	How about this?	I'm done playing games!
H2S0	You want another, do you?	Of course. But not quite as rough this time.	And that was for Osiris!	Ever tried it on your knees, boy?	That...hurt.	It only gets worse from here.	And that was for Osiris!	You don't have what it takes to be king. Like father, like son.
H1S1	I won't break as easily as that!	I'll carve that on your sarcophagus.	Surrender now and I might spare your life!	I'm still here, nephew. Why are you?	You think yourself a better king than I?	I am the dead king's son! It is my right.	My father will be avenged!	You don't want the throne. It makes you a target for fleas.
H2S1H	You're weakening. I can see it.	That must be the blood in your eyes.	Enough of this!	I'm not finished yet!	How are you still standing?	The sun always rises, Set.	Your time is come, usurper!	Looks like it's not tomorrow yet.
H1S2	I'll just keep coming back!	Keep talking dirty. I like it.	I will never yield to you!	You should try to last longer.	You're not the only resiliant one.	It runs in my family.	Now we finish this!	Maybe I'll feed your heart to my dog.
H2S1S	Father...	That's right, boy. You'll see him soon.	Pray the scales are more merciful than I!	Tell my brother the king sends his regards!	You self-righteous chicken! I will eat you!	The last words of a fallen king!	Remember this moment, Set. This is what justice feels like.	That...Is...It.
S1H0	This is nothing! You are nothing!	Looks like you've got some nothing on you, then.	This is Egypt's king, is it?	Stop hitting yourself, Horus.	Okay, so you've got some skill. I've got a crown.	And borrowed time!	Time's up, Set!	You'll never be king like this, boy.
S2H0	I don't need both eyes to avenge my father, fool!	Good thing, then.	You will pay for that.	Personally, I think it's an improvement.	Don't let your eye wander, boy. I'm right here!	Oh no, I'm able to focus now!	Even with one eye.	Personally, I think it's an improvement.
S1H1	Is that all you've got?	Is that all you can take?	I can do this all day.	He should've taught you how to fight.	He didn't teach you how to fight, at least.	Oh, this is nothing.	Do you yield?	Self-righteous twerp.
S2H1H	No! I...I can't lose!	A little late for that!	I will never stop!	Good try, Horus. Maybe next time.	Nothing good in life comes easily, Horus. Can't you see?	I can see that you're weakening!	We're not finished yet, Set.	Are you blinded to the truth? You're finished!
S1H2	Last warning. Give up now!	Show me how, boy!	No more! You die now!	I...AM...KING.	Stop...stop spinning! All of you!	This is your final warning!	Enough of this!	There you are!
S2H1S	I'll never give up! You'll have to kill me!	That's the plan, boy!	The best laid plans.	Kill you, eh? Yes, that's a good idea.	Enough of this! I am the king!	Not for much longer!	You're no king! I'll show you a king!	Still got it.
2all	No! It won't end like this!	It's too late for anything else, Horus.	Father...	Shame it had to come to this.	Last warning, Horus. Leave now.	Not before I make this right!	Father...	Shame it had to come to this.
Time Out 1	You're wasting my time.	Funny, I was thinking the same thing.	I will show you what ruthlessness means, Set.	Come on, boy! At least give it a try!	That's uncalled for. What did I ever do to you?	How dare you make light of it!?!	To think I considered showing mercy.	Your father didn't have a sense of humor either.
Non Violent 1	You're not the only one who can lie, Set!	Good. I was worried there was nothing of me inside you.	This is nothing less than you deserve, murderer.	Your father would have wept to see you strike me.	Too trusting. You get that from your father!	Won't you listen to reason?	Your death is on your own head. I would have spared you.	Didn't your father ever tell you not to let your guard down?
